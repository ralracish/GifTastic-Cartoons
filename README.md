# GifTastic-Cartoons
GifTastic- Cartoon version

In this application, you can click on any of the cartoon buttons to display .gif images related to that cartoon, along with their ratings. 

When you click on the still image, the .gif will animate.  When you click an animated image, it will become still.

You may also add a cartoon of your choosing to the text box that is designated as "Add a cartoon!"  Then your button will appear alongside the original buttons and you can click it to pull .gif images related to the cartoon you entered. You may add as many cartoons as you like.
